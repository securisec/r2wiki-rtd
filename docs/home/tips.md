# Tips

## Unorganized random tips

- Use `~/.radare2rc` to make any config or cmd run everytime radare2 is loaded.
- To run the same command multiple times, prepend the number before the command. Example: `3dc` will run `dc` three times
- To run radare2 without a binary, use a `-` as the argument instead of a filepath
- You can get any output in `less` format by using `[command] ~..`
- To find crypto keys, use `/Ca` (AES), or `/Cr` (RSA) keys
- Set `e asm.emu =1` to emulate cpu instructions.
- Use `~{}` after any json output to make pretty print. Ex: `pdfj~{}`
- Use `drr` to see what values registers are pointing to. This is similar to the register view in gdb peda.
- Use `pxr` for stack analysis (helpful for pwn challenges)
- Use `~...` for a HUD style navigator. Really handly searching inside functions. Example, search for calls
- Use `afn` to rename functions. In visual mode, use `dr` instead
- In visual mode, pressing the number inside square brackets i.e `[1]` will move seek to that address. This generally applies to calls or jumps
- Set `e asm.describe = true` to have inline description of that each line does. This can be set in the default radare2 config file located at `~/.radare2rc`
- Search hexadecimal of a string by prepending the string with a `\x` . For example, `/ \xELF`
- To find AES or RSA keys in memory, load radare as `sudo radare2 /dev/mem` and then search with `/Ca` or `/Cr`
- Use `drr` for register references like peda
- Use `=H` inside radare2 shell to start and launch r2 webserver.
- Set environment variables as `setenv=foo=bar` in the .rr file and load it along with the binary
- Equivalent of "set-follow-fork-mode" gdb command. First, `dcf` until a fork happens, and then `dp` to see all child processes
- When debugging a binary, use `e dbg.bep=main` or entry to bypass the loader. This can be made persistant in `~/.radare2rc`
- Use the back tick ``` to wrap a command to use as the input to another command. Example. This command will take the address xref to of somestr and seek to that address. 
	```
	s axt `str.some~[1]`
	``` 
- The `$$` represents here (current seek)
- Press space bar to switch between `V` and `VV`
- Use `agv` to open a grapviz flow graph
- Set `?E `fo`` in `~/.radare2rc` to show clippy style fortune messages
- [Floss](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-floss/releases) has a radare2 output using `-r`
- When commenting out a line in `~/.radare2rc` , dont do `#foo` . Use `# foo` . That space is important
- To pass arguments to a python script inside r2 shell, use #!pipe python script.py args
- Most commands accept `-` as argument-prefix as an indication to delete something
- Set `e cfg.newtab = 1` to enable command autocompletion
- Use `!` at the end of an offset followed by the number of bytes to limit the amount of bytes that are shown. Example `pxr @ esp!32`
- To set conditional breakpoints, see the example [here](/home/misc/usage-examples#debug)
- ðŸš€ To change the value of a local variable, use `afv` to find the offset, followed by whatever you want to write, like `w` for strings [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/IC3jEr2Wt3nCDG5OU3qkoHyZE)
- Use `r2 -qc /m some_file` as a replacement for binwalk! `e search.align` can be used to tweak how the search works. Example `e search.align=4k`
- Found files can be written to disk using the `wtf` command
- To load contents of another program that generates r2 commands, prefix it with `.!`
- To use the keystone disassbler (the default r2 is better), install it using:
	- `r2pm -i keystone-lib`
	- `r2pm -i keystone`
	- And then invoke with either `r2 -a arm.ks` or from shell `e asm.assembler = arm.ks`
- The radare2 command line history can be found in `$HOME/.config/radare2/history`
- You can use rarun profile paramaters directly using `radare2 -R [arg1=foo] [stdin=bar] [preload=baz] -d binary`
- To find addresses of all functions, use `s @@f`
- To search for something in memory, use `/v` in conjuction with `e search.in=dbg.maps`
- To dump types, like C++, use this [resource](https://radare.gitbooks.io/radare2book/content/analysis/types.html)
- Use `?v $r{register}` to access register values
- To see if analysis has been done, check `aflc != 0`


## Tips from fortunes
- > These tips are from the radare2 fortunes 

- Add comments using the `;` key in visual mode or the `CC` command from the radare2 shell
- Add custom Have you setup your ~/.radare2rc today?
- Analyze socket connections with the socket plugin: `radare2 socket://www.foo.com:80`. Use `w` to send data
- Assemble opcodes with the `a` and `A` keys in visual mode, which are bindings to the `wa` and `wA` commands
- Bindiff two files with `$ radiff2 /bin/true /bin/false`
- Calculate checksums for the current block with the commands starting with `#` (#md5, #crc32, #all, ..)

- Switch between print modes using the `p` and `P` keys in visual mode
- Temporally drop the verbosity prefixing the commands with `:`
- Thanks for using radare2!
- The `?` command can be used to evaluate math expressions. Like this: `? (0x34+22)*4`
- The more `a` you add after `aa` the more analysis steps are executed.
